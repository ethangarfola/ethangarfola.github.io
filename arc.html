        <img src="images/arc/arc sub.png" alt="Arc Subclass">
        <p>Subclass: Gathering Storm</p>
        <p>Aspects: Lethal Current and Flow State. So that you can get the maximum benifits out of the jolt affect.</p>
        <p>Fragments: Most would work well and you can use which ever you prefer, however 1 is recommended and 1 is a must for the build. The one that is recommended is Spark of Discharge. This fragement creates an ionic trace when an enemy is killed with an arc weapon. This is useful because when the ionic trace reaches you, it will give you a boost for all of your abilities, including grenade energy. The fragment that is the most necessary for this build is the Spark of Shock. This fragment makes it so grenades apply jolt. Jolt is very important for arc, so having it applied to as many enemies as possible makes the build even stronger.</p>
        <p>The playstyle is very simple. First you want to throw a skip grenade to apply jolt and get kills. Then you use the class ability to trigger bomber and reaper. Following that, you can use arc weapons to get as many kills as possible until you have the skip grenades returned to you, and then you do it again. You will find that you have grenades to throw significantly faster than any other build, making it great for add clear and certain boss fights.</p>
