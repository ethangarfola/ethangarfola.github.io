        <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
        <p>I started doing mountain biking racing my freshman year of highschool. I started off pretty slow and every race was a struggle, but I still thought it was fun.
        Suprisingly, I ended up making it to the NorCal championship for my group, which was pretty significant considering how big mountain biking is in Northern California.
        The next year was the same story, slowly getting better, and once again making it to the championships. I was never very good, but I was still riding.
        So far, Junior year, there has been a lot of improvement, and I am placing significantly higher in my races than the previous years, so we will just see how that goes.
        </p>
        <h2>Lacrosse</h2>
        <p>I started playing lacrosse in 7th grade, but I have never been very good.
        I am a very athletic individual, but I don't have a lot of game sense.
        I have been on the redwood team since freshman year, playing JV up until Junior year.
        Juniour year I made it onto the varsity team, and it has been a great experience.
        We are one of the best teams in California-and the United States, and playing varsity has made me into a better
        player.
