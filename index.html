    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>At the time of making this website, I am a junior at Redwood Highschool.
        I have 2 little sisters who both have red hair-I don't.
        I have an Irish Terrier named Bacon, and we just got a new puppy that is a Labrador-Pitbull mix named Malone.
        I do Mountain Biking and Lacrosse, both sports are during the same season.
        I love being active, either weightlifting or just general fitness.
        I like going to the beach with my friends, along with playing videogames and unwinding at home.
