        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>At the time of making this website, I am a junior at Redwood Highschool. I have 2 little sisters who both have red hair—I don't. I have an Irish Terrier named Bacon, and we just got a new puppy that is a Labrador-Pitbull mix named Malone. I do Mountain Biking and Lacrosse, both sports are during the same season. I love being active, either weightlifting or just general fitness. I like going to the beach with my friends, along with playing video games and unwinding at home.</p>
