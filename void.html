        <p>These mods mostly contribute to help with grenade uptime. This may be confusing, as the key aspect to this build aren't the grenades, its the smoke bomb melee. They key is the arm mod, momentum transfer. This mod makes it so that grenade damage creates melee energy, making all the grenade energy mods worth it.</p>
        <img src="images/void/void sub.png" alt="Void Subclass">
        <p>Subclass: Shadowshot: Moebius Quiver</p>
        <p>Aspects: Trapper's Ambush and Vanishing Step. So that you are constanly invisible as often as possible</p>
        <p>Fragments: Mostly preference, however 2 that are neceassary for the build are Echo of Obscurity, where final blows make you invisible, and Echo of Persistence, where void buffs like invisibility have an increased duration. </p>
        <p>Use smoke bomb to become invisible for 9 seconds, then use class ability near an enemy to refund a smoke bomb and become invisible for another 9 seconds. Use smoke bomb and become invisble for another 9 seconds. Use vortex grenade to regain some more melee energy, and then use dodge for more invisibility and to refund the smoke bomb. If timed right, it is possible to remain invisible indefinitely.</p>
