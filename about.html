    <h2>Student Athlete</h2>
    <a href="/index.html">Home Page</a>
    <p>As a student athlete, I have a very busy life.
        However, there is a reason student comes first.
        I try my hardest to maintain straight A's across all of my classes, and so far I have been succesful.</p>
    <p>It has been made difficult by the beggining of the sports season.
        I play varsity lacrosse, which is very strenuous on it's own, but with mountain biking racing thrown into the
        mix at the same time, I often find myself very tired.</p>
